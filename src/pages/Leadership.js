                            The main goal of the program is peer teaching. Therefore, as a staff, we were assigned numerous classes we needed to give, as part of our curriculum, either during summer camps or regular training days during the school year. Some were about military training, others on aviation, and many on leadership. Out of all the subjects, I loved sharing personal experiences on leadership. I would always tell my Cadets how valuable everyone is in a team and how important it is to use the strengths of others instead of doing everything by yourself. As a music Staff during summer camps, I would teach cadets how to be in charge of a group and music theory and musical direction. As a Cadet, the highest marks in my evaluations were always related to teaching and instruction. I show lots of charisma and try to make classes as entertaining as possible since I believe I play a crucial role in the development of teenagers. Over the years, I have seen young Cadets grow up and become Staff members, overseeing a group of people. Once again, they would teach others what they have learned over their career. Without a doubt, everyone in the program plays an essential role in instruction, and just like me, people in the program will keep on shaping the lives of tomorrow's leaders.

                            As the yearbook committee leader at Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf, I oversaw the project, rallying peers and discussing with external contributors and businesses. We overcame challenges such as the inclusion of club photos by using Photoshop and finding new settings to photograph students given COVID-19 protocols, ensuring a memorable yearbook for my graduating class. This role will remain one of my proudest achievements.                        Furthermore. the French Newspaper committee has successfully published two issues during the 2020-2021 academic year.

                            <p class="card-text">In the academic year 2022-2023, as Vice-President of External Affairs at John Abbott College, I was an executive member of CASAQ, an association comprising representatives from the five anglophone CEGEPs in Montreal (John Abbott College, Marianopolis, Dawson, Vanier, and Champlain Regional College). The role gave me the opportunity to represent not only the voice of my school, but the voice of all students attending anglophone institutions in Montreal. I was responsible for maintaining relationships and organizing activities by engaging with colleges and businesses.
                            <br/><br/>In my role as a secretary for the Student Union of John Abbott College in the year 2021-2022, my consistent interaction with the chairperson played a crucial part in ensuring the seamless flow of meetings. As a Congress member, I actively shaped decisions that impacted student life, but it was my responsibility as a secretary to meticulously document and secure approval for the weekly meeting minutes and decisions.
                            <br/><br/> As Student-Council Vice-President for my high school graduating cohort, after coming back from COVID, we worked hard to organize important activities to make sure that everyone had an unforgettable last year. We planned events such as prom, fundraising initiatives, carnival, graduation party and more. These activities brought our school community closer together and created lasting memories. Overall, being on the student council was a great way to make the most of my last year of high school.
